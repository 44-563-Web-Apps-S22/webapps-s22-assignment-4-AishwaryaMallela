    <h4>ACT I SCENE III--HARPAGON, LA FLÃˆCHE.</h4>
    <p>
        HAR. Get out of here, this moment; and let me have no more of your
        prating. Now then, be gone out of my house, you sworn pickpocket, you
        veritable gallows' bird.<br>

        LA FL. (_aside_). I never saw anything more wicked than this
        cursed old man; and I truly believe, if I may be allowed to say so,
        that he is possessed with a devil.<br>

        HAR. What are you muttering there between your teeth?<br>

        LA FL. Why do you send me away?<br>

        HAR. You dare to ask me my reasons, you scoundrel? Out with you, this
        moment, before I give you a good thrashing.<br>

        LA FL. What have I done to you?<br>

        HAR. Done this, that I wish you to be off.<br>
