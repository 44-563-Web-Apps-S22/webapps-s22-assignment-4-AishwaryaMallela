                Get out of here, this moment; and let me have no more of your
                prating. Now then, be gone out of my house, you sworn pickpocket, you
                veritable gallows' bird.

                (_aside_). I never saw anything more wicked than this
                cursed old man; and I truly believe, if I may be allowed to say so,
                that he is possessed with a devil.

                What are you muttering there between your teeth?
            </p>

            <p>
                Why do you send me away?
            </p>

        <p>
            <h6>HAR.</h6> 
            <p>
                You dare to ask me my reasons, you scoundrel? Out with you, this
                moment, before I give you a good thrashing.
            </p>

                What have I done to you?

        <p>
            <h6>HAR.</h6>

                Done this, that I wish you to be off.
